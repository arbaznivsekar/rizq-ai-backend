# RIZQ.AI Backend - Enterprise Scraping Architecture Rules

## Code Quality Standards
- Use TypeScript strict mode with comprehensive type definitions
- Follow ESLint rules and Prettier formatting
- Implement comprehensive error handling with custom error classes
- Use async/await patterns consistently
- Include JSDoc documentation for all public methods
- Implement proper logging with structured data

## Architecture Patterns
- Follow SOLID principles and dependency injection
- Use abstract classes for common scraper functionality
- Implement factory pattern for scraper instantiation
- Use strategy pattern for different anti-bot techniques
- Implement observer pattern for scraping events
- Use repository pattern for data access

## Compliance & Legal Requirements
- GDPR/CCPA compliance by design
- Respect robots.txt and rate limiting
- Implement data anonymization and encryption
- Maintain audit trails for all scraping activities
- Monitor terms of service changes
- Implement graceful degradation for blocked requests

## Security & Anti-Detection
- Rotate user agents and browser fingerprints
- Implement residential proxy rotation
- Use human-like behavior simulation
- Implement CAPTCHA solving integration
- Monitor and adapt to anti-bot measures
- Implement session persistence and cookie management

## Performance & Scalability
- Use Redis for job queuing and caching
- Implement connection pooling for databases
- Use streaming for large data processing
- Implement circuit breakers for external services
- Use worker pools for parallel processing
- Implement graceful shutdown and recovery

## Testing Standards
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for scraper components
- Mock external services in tests
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Implement performance benchmarks
- Use fixtures for consistent test data

## Error Handling
- Custom error classes for different failure types
- Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Log errors with structured context
- Implement circuit breakers for failing services
- Graceful degradation for non-critical failures
- Alert on critical system failures

## Monitoring & Observability
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Use metrics for performance monitoring
- Implement health checks for all components
- Monitor scraping success rates and quality
- Track proxy health and rotation
- Implement alerting for system issues
