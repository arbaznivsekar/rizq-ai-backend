# RIZQ.AI Multi-Domain Job Scraping Guide

This guide explains how to use the new multi-domain job scraping tools to scrape jobs from different domains and job boards including Indeed and Naukri.com.

## Problem Solved

## Available Job Boards

### 1. Indeed.com (International)
- **Multi-domain scraper**: `test-multi-domain-turnstile-bypass.mjs`
- **Configurable scraper**: `test-configurable-turnstile-bypass.mjs`

### 2. Naukri.com (India) ‚≠ê **NEW**
- **Multi-domain scraper**: `test-naukri-multi-domain-scraper.mjs`
- **Configurable scraper**: `test-naukri-configurable-scraper.mjs`

## Naukri.com Scrapers (Indian Job Market) ‚≠ê

### 1. Multi-Domain Naukri Scraper (`test-naukri-multi-domain-scraper.mjs`)

## Output Files

All tools save results to JSON files with descriptive names:

## Rate Limiting and Best Practices

- All scrapers include built-in delays to avoid rate limiting
- Use `--max-jobs` to control the number of jobs scraped per search
- Start with smaller numbers for testing
- Be respectful of the job board servers
- The bypass tools are more reliable but may take longer to complete

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Protection detection**: Use the **bypass** tools (recommended)
2. **No jobs found**: Try different locations or search terms
3. **Rate limiting**: The bypass tools handle this automatically
4. **Browser errors**: Ensure Playwright is properly installed
5. **Network issues**: Check your internet connection

### Error Messages:

- `Protection detected`: Use the **bypass** tools
- `Anti-bot detection`: The bypass tools handle this automatically
- `Network timeouts`: Connection issues
- `Browser launch failed`: Playwright installation issues

### Success Indicators:

- ‚úÖ `Successfully bypassed protection!`
- ‚úÖ `Successfully accessed Naukri.com main page!`
- ‚úÖ `Successfully accessed Indeed main page!`
- ‚úÖ `Aggressive extraction found X jobs`
- ‚úÖ `Results saved to: filename.json`

## Next Steps

1. **Start with bypass tools** for best results
2. Try scraping different domains to see what jobs are available
3. Experiment with different locations and search terms
4. Analyze the scraped data to understand job market trends
5. Use the data for job market research or recruitment purposes

## File Locations

### ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED** (Bypass Protection):
- **Naukri.com Multi-domain**: `test-naukri-multi-domain-scraper.mjs`
- **Naukri.com Configurable**: `test-naukri-configurable-scraper.mjs`
- **Indeed.com Multi-domain**: `test-multi-domain-turnstile-bypass.mjs`
- **Indeed.com Configurable**: `test-configurable-turnstile-bypass.mjs`

### Legacy Tools (May Fail):
- **Multi-domain scraper**: `test-multi-domain-scraping.mjs`
- **Configurable scraper**: `test-configurable-scraping.mjs`
- **Original scraper**: `test-simple-scraping.mjs`

### Output files: Saved in the same directory as the scripts

## Quick Start

For the best experience, start with:

```bash
# Naukri.com - List available domains
node test-naukri-multi-domain-scraper.mjs list

# Naukri.com - Try marketing jobs
node test-naukri-multi-domain-scraper.mjs marketing

# Naukri.com - Try a custom search
node test-naukri-configurable-scraper.mjs "data scientist"

# Indeed.com - List available domains
node test-multi-domain-turnstile-bypass.mjs list

# Indeed.com - Try marketing jobs
node test-multi-domain-turnstile-bypass.mjs marketing

# Indeed.com - Try a custom search
node test-configurable-turnstile-bypass.mjs "data scientist"
```

The **bypass** tools will handle anti-bot protection automatically and provide reliable results from both job boards!
